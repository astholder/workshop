You are the sunlight in my day

You are the moon I see far away

You are the one I lean upon

You are the one who makes my troubles gone

You are the one who taught me life

how not to fight and the difference between right

and wrong

You are the words within my song

You are my wonderful MOM

You are the one who cares for me

You are the eyes that help me see

You are the one who knows me best

You are my favorite from east to west

You are the one who helped me dream

You hear my heart

You hear me scream

I’m afraid of life but looking for love

I’m blessed that God sent me you from above

You are my friend, my heart, and soul

You are the greatest MOM I know
